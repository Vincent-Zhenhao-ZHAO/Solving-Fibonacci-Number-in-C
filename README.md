For this coursework we want to create a very simple C program that takes a number as an input and returns the perimeter of a sequence of squares.

The rectangle is aranged as follows:

The image shows 8 squares with a side length of of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21 respectively. If we sum up the perimeters of these squares we get : 4 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21) = 352

In perimeter.c write a function that gives the sum of the perimeters of n+1 such squares.
